"""MCP server skeleton for the Gulf and Middle East skill.

Nothing here screens anything yet. Each tool is declared so the transport and
tool surface can be exercised, and each one refuses instead of answering.

The first version of this file returned `{"status": "clear", "confidence": 0.95}`
for any entity name it was given, and AGENTS.md points an agent at this file to
"expose tools to the agent". A fabricated clearance is worse than no tool: an
agent has no way to tell it apart from a real screening result. Until a tool is
backed by an actual source, it must say so.
